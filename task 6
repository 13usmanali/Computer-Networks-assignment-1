1. What is the name of the website?

The destination IP address is 172.217.169.208, which belongs to Google. 
This suggests the website accessed is likely a Google service

2. Find the packet that contains the Initial QUIC handshake. What information is exchanged here?

The Initial QUIC handshake is in Frame 214. Key information exchanged includes:
Packet Type: Initial (0)
Destination Connection ID: b3e9cb19b9a67babba6f45c3b05d8c5e
Source Connection ID: ffa7797c
Packet Length: 945 bytes
Payload Length: 917 bytes
Encrypted Data: Contains the TLS ClientHello message

3. Identify the QUIC packet that contains the TLS ClientHello.

Also in Frame 214, the TLSv1.3 Record Layer Handshake Protocol Client
Hello is embedded within the QUIC Initial packet. This is part of QUIC's 
design to integrate TLS directly into its transport layer.

4. Which QUIC version is used in your trace?

The image does not explicitly show the QUIC version field. However, since it includes TLS 1.3
and uses the Long Header with Initial Packet Type, it is consistent with IETF QUIC version 1.

5. Locate the packet where 0-RTT or 1-RTT keys are first used.

The image does not show the full trace, but typically:
0-RTT is used when a client resumes a previous session.
1-RTT is used after the handshake completes.
Since this is an Initial packet with ClientHello, the 1-RTT keys would be used in subsequent
packets after the handshake completes. You would need to look for packets labeled as Short 
Header with encrypted application data to identify this.

6. Find the first packet that carries application data (HTTP/3). How does this differ from HTTP over TCP?

first HTTP/3 packet would be a Short Header QUIC packet carrying encrypted application data.
Difference from HTTP over TCP:
QUIC uses UDP, not TCP.
QUIC integrates TLS 1.3 directly into the protocol.
QUIC supports multiplexing without head-of-line blocking.
QUIC enables faster connection establishment with 0-RTT and 1-RTT.
